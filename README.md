# Hise_Synth_featuresv1

Building a vst synth using Hise's drag and drop features.

Demo of vst for educational purposes, and feedback.

Areas of Interest.

1.  The unison settings, are not operational, I dont know if this is a level stack order issue.

2.  I wonder if there is a way to beef up the voices because the synth is kind of light.

3.  I would like to add a page for macros to automate certain parameters.

4.  I would like a tab for an arpeggiator.

5.  I would like to add a xy pad automatable matrices.

Feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Source files available upon request for educational purposes.

VST 2.  Demo.   Put the folder in your vst2folder and fire up your daw of preference.  Scan for the plugin and fire up and instance of the demo synth.
