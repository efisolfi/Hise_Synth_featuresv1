# Hise_Synth_featuresv1

Building a vst synth using Hise's drag and drop features.

Demo of vst for educational purposes, and feedback.

Areas of Interest.

The unison settings, are not operational, I dont know if this is a level stack order issue.
I wonder if there is a way to beef up the voices because the synth is kind of light.
I would like to add a page for macros to automate certain parameters.
I would like an arpeggiator.
I would like to add a xy pad automatable matrices.

Feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks.
